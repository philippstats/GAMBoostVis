# GAMBoostVis
Visualisation package for R package GAMBoost (Likelihood-Based Boosting)

Second version of GAMBoostVis which contains plot functions for GAMBoost objects.
Please not that this package is not tested a lot and was exclusively created for a seminar thesis. Therefore it lacks on flexible plotting functionality. 

Whole power of GAMBoostVis is only accessable when response is added to GAMBoost object.
